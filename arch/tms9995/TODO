- We are broken if you have a vararg function of the form (char *, long ...)
  because we blindly push both r4 and r5. We need to spot this case and only
  push r4 somehow.
- Get rid of R10 oddity - we can use it now we dont alias regs
- Why do we need the mess we have on CALL - can we rewrite the tree earlier
  to add a UMUL between CALL -> not ICON
- Finish review of condition codes
- Struct returns need to allow for extra word due to BL behaviour ?
- Is there a way to tell the compiler that mov sets just the EQ/NE status
  so that

	MOVB *R1,R2
	JEQ
  is valid ?
- PIC for internal helpers (bl @div32(r15) etc)

Longer term
- Post increment modes
- Stack direction ?


Oddity
-   &p for the first argument is offset 0 from the fp. This causes the code
    generator to output a bogus add of 0. Looks like a core compiler bug
    rather than it erroring the address take of a register argument
