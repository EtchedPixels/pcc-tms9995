- Get rid of R10 oddity - we can use it now we dont alias regs
- Finish review of condition codes
- Use b *r13+ over mov *r13+,r11, rt
- Struct returns need to allow for extra word due to BL behaviour ?
- Is there a way to tell the compiler that mov sets just the EQ/NE status
  so that

	MOVB *R1,R2
	JEQ
  is valid ?
- PIC for internal helpers (bl @div32(r15) etc)

Longer term
- Post increment modes
- Register arguments for first 1 or 2 words  (non vararg?)
	See pdp10 example
