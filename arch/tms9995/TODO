- Swap the 32bit high/low pairs over so that RP01 matches the desired order
  for FP and DIV.
- The DIV rule for TINT needs to sign extend R1 into R0 not clear it
  (and for the swap to be sorted)
- Finish review of condition codes
- Optimise non-use of R0 indirection. Maybe also favour not using R0/R1 when
  there is a choice ?
- Struct returns need to allow for extra word due to BL behaviour ?
- Is there a way to tell the compiler that mov sets just the EQ/NE status
  so that

	MOVB *R1,R2
	JEQ
  is valid ?
- PIC for internal helpers (bl @div32(r15) etc)

Longer term
- Post increment modes
