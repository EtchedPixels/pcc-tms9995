- Optimise non-use of R0 indirection. Maybe also favour not using R0/R1 when
  there is a choice ?
- Move FP, PC out of the R0-R7 range.
- Use the other registers. This requires a bunch of work to replace all
  the register name printing logic and sorting out COLORMAP
- Struct returns need to allow for extra word due to BL behaviour ?
- Clean up li ops to use helpers to use clr for 32bit
- Is there a way to tell the compiler that mov sets just the EQ/NE status
  so that

	MOVB *R1,R2
	JEQ
  is valid ?

Longer term
- Register support
- Post increment modes
- Matching +2 -2 for INCT/DECT
- PIC data (actually really easy to do)
