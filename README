TMS 9995 C Compiler Project

This is a porting project based around the ANSI pcc compiler maintained by
Anders Magnusson. The original still lives in CVS so I'm keeping my working
tree in something a little less retro.

To build

autoconf
./configure --target=tms9995-fuzix
make

and it should build you a ccom and probably then error about a ccom2.

At this point only the compiler phase is relevant and there are still some
changes needed to the matching as9995 (in the CC68 tree for ... reasons ... )
to move beyond the visual inspection stage.
