TMS 9995 C Compiler Project

This is a porting project based around the ANSI pcc compiler maintained by
Anders Magnusson. The original still lives in CVS so I'm keeping my working
tree in something a little less retro.

To build

autoconf
./configure --target=tms9995-fuzix
make

and it should build you a ccom and probably then error about a ccom2.

For the full setup see the pcc-tms9995-support github.

Status

At this point the compiler can correctly build and run various test projects
and should be usable although there may be some bugs lurking.
